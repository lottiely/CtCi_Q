In this repository you will find my takeaways from reading Cracking the 
Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. This includes:

* Reports on topics I wanted to explore which may or may not have 
further research from other sources. 

* Answers to the questions in the book. Some will be solutions I tried 
to implement, and some will be based on the answer in the book.

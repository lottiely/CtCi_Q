"CtCi_Q" 

These are my takeaways from reading Cracking the Coding Interview by 
Gaayle Laakmann McDowell. These include:

* Reports on subjects I wanted to explore more thoroughly which may or 
may not include other resources.

* Solutions to the questions in the book. Some may be my own solutions 
and some just may be regurgitated solutions from the book.
